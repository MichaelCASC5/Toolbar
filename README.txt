Michael Calle - Toolbar Class

*** HOW TO LAUNCH ***
Simply go to the command line and enter the command: javac *.java;java Driver.java

This will compile all the code and execute Driver.java
You will need to have Java installed on your machine to be able to do this.

*** HOW TO USE ***
The purpose of this program is to put an interactive toolbar at the top of the GUI. It's quite easy to use and navigate. In Toolbar.java, you may specify the amount of drop down menus you would like to have. You can customize the content of each drop down menu. In Drop.java, the code for the drop down menu can be found. There, you may specify what action you would like each option in all the drop down menus to perform.

Thank you for checking this source code out! If you decide to incorporate my toolbar in any of your projects, feel free to do so, just contact me or give me credit for my work.
